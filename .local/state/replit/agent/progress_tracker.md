## Enhancement Summary
✅ **Payment Data Processing**: The system now extracts payment information from both CSV and ZIP files:
- **CSV Processing**: Extracts payment status from "Reason for Credit Entry" field (DELIVERED → PAID, RTO_COMPLETE → REFUNDED, etc.)
- **ZIP Processing**: Handles payment settlement files (XLSX format) and updates orders with actual payment dates and settlement amounts
- **Database Integration**: Orders table now includes paymentStatus and paymentDate columns for comprehensive payment tracking
- **Frontend Enhancement**: Orders page displays enhanced payment status badges with proper color coding and status mapping
- **Data Reconciliation**: Automatic reconciliation of payment settlement data with existing orders

## Previous Known Issues
- **Login Redirect Issue**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Added explicit navigation after successful authentication. The authentication flow now uses explicit `setLocation('/')` calls after successful login instead of relying only on component re-rendering.

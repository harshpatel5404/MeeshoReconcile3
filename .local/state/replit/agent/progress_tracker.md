## Known Issues
- **Login Redirect Issue**: After successful login, users may not be automatically redirected to the dashboard. This is due to the authentication flow relying on React component re-rendering rather than explicit navigation. The authentication is working correctly (backend API calls succeed), but the frontend component state update doesn't always trigger the expected redirect from login to dashboard view.

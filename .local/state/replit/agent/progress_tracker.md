## Enhancement Summary
✅ **Payment Data Processing**: The system now extracts payment information from both CSV and ZIP files:
- **CSV Processing**: Extracts payment status from "Reason for Credit Entry" field (DELIVERED → PAID, RTO_COMPLETE → REFUNDED, etc.)
- **ZIP Processing**: Handles payment settlement files (XLSX format) and updates orders with actual payment dates and settlement amounts
- **Database Integration**: Orders table now includes paymentStatus and paymentDate columns for comprehensive payment tracking
- **Frontend Enhancement**: Orders page displays enhanced payment status badges with proper color coding and status mapping
- **Data Reconciliation**: Automatic reconciliation of payment settlement data with existing orders

## Previous Known Issues
- **Login Redirect Issue**: After successful login, users may not be automatically redirected to the dashboard. This is due to the authentication flow relying on React component re-rendering rather than explicit navigation. The authentication is working correctly (backend API calls succeed), but the frontend component state update doesn't always trigger the expected redirect from login to dashboard view.
